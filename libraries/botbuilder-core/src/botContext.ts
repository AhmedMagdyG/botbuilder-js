 * 
 * For TypeScript developers the `BotContext` is also exposed as an interface which you can derive
 * from to better describe the actual shape of the context object being passed around.  Middleware
 * can potentially extend the context object with additional members so in order to get intellisense 
 * for those added members you'll need to define them on an interface that extends BotContext:
 *
 * ```JavaScript
 * interface MyContext extends BotContext {
 *      // Added by UserState middleware.
 *      readonly userState: MyUserState;
 * 
 *      // Added by ConversationState middleware.
 *      readonly conversationState: MyConversationState;
 * }
 * 
 * adapter.processRequest(req, res, (context: MyContext) => {
 *      const state = context.conversationState;
 * });
